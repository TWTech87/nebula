## Overview
![nebula](/images/overview.png)
Nebula represents the forefront of technological innovation, serving as an AI-powered assistant specifically designed for the field of ethical hacking. It provides a unique capability for users to input commands using natural language processing, facilitating a seamless transition from intent to execution.

Additionally, Nebula offers a  hacking command search engine. Ethical hackers can effortlessly search for protocols, ports, or specific terms. In response, Nebula provides curated suggestions on commands that can aid in identifying potential vulnerabilities.

Currently, Nebula is integrated with and supports the following renowned ethical hacking tools:

- NMAP: A versatile tool for network discovery and security auditing.
- OWASP ZAP: A highly regarded web application security scanner.
- Crackmap: A robust network information gathering tool.

Our roadmap envisions Nebula's continuous expansion to incorporate the majority of the leading tools leveraged by ethical hackers globally. This commitment ensures that our users remain at the cutting edge of cybersecurity endeavors.

## Usage

There are two primary applications for Nebulla:

- Functioning as a dedicated search engine.
- Serving as an AI-driven assistant (currently in beta).

Within the search engine capability, ethical hackers can input port numbers or specific protocol names. In return, they will receive recommended commands to assist in the identification of potential vulnerabilities. Please refer to the GIF provided below for an illustrative example.

Queries can be presented naturally to the AI-driven assistant, which then translates them into specific commands. In the current beta release, it is essential for the ethical hacker to have prior familiarity with this tool to formulate valid inquiries effectively. Refer to the example provided below for a demonstration.
