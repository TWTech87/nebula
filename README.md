## Acknowledgement

First i would like to thank the All-Mighty God who is the source of all knowledge, without Him, this would not be possible.

## Why nebula?

- Effortless Tool Usage with Natural Language: No need to remember intricate commands or switches for various tools. With Nebula, you can seamlessly communicate your intent, whether it's initiating an Nmap scan or any other task. Let Nebula translate your natural language into precise tool commands.

- Direct Command Line Access: Execute suggested commands without having to copy and paste.

- Smart Analysis of Tool Outputs: Whether it's the open ports from an Nmap scan or results from other tools, Nebula provides tailored suggestions to further investigate and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Disclaimer**: Only NMAP is currently supported for smart analysis of tool output.

- Command Search for Vulnerabilities: Easily search and retrieve commands that aid in detecting vulnerabilities across a range of protocols. Whether you're dealing with HTTP, FTP, or SMB, Nebula guides you through.

## Overview
![nebula](/images/overview.png)
Nebula represents the forefront of technological innovation, serving as an AI-powered assistant specifically designed for the field of ethical hacking. It provides a unique capability for users to input commands using natural language processing, facilitating a seamless transition from intent to execution.

Additionally, Nebula offers a  hacking command search engine. Ethical hackers can effortlessly search for protocols, ports, or specific terms. In response, Nebula provides curated suggestions on commands that can aid in identifying potential vulnerabilities.

Currently, Nebula is integrated with and supports the following renowned ethical hacking tools:

- NMAP: A versatile tool for network discovery and security auditing.
- OWASP ZAP (Full Scan Only): A popular web application security scanner.
- Crackmap: A robust network information gathering tool.

Our roadmap envisions Nebula's continuous expansion to incorporate the majority of the tools leveraged by ethical hackers globally. This commitment ensures that our users remain at the cutting edge of cybersecurity endeavors.

## Compatibility

Nebula has been extensively tested and optimized for Linux and MacOS platforms. As of now, its functionality on Windows is not guaranteed, and it may not operate as expected.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to use the docker image. Please note that the ZAP model is NOT supported in the docker image. If you would like to use ZAP please install the package using `pip`.

Docker Usage:

Without GPU:

```bash
docker run -it berylliumsec/nebula:latest
```

To avoid downloading the models each time you run the docker container, mount a directory to store the models like so:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/app/unified_models_no_zap -it berylliumsec/nebula:latest
```

With all GPU(s)

```bash
docker run --gpus all -v "$(pwd)":/app/unified_models_no_zap -it nebula:latest

```

```bash
docker run --gpus all -v "$(pwd)":/app/unified_models -it nebula:latest
```
PIP installation:

```
pip install nebula
```

To run nebula simpy enter `nebula` in your command line interface.

## Usage

There are two primary applications for Nebulla:

- Functioning as a dedicated search engine.
- Serving as an AI-driven assistant (currently in beta).

### As a search engine:

Within the search engine capability, ethical hackers can input port numbers or specific protocol names. In return, they will receive recommended commands to assist in the identification of potential vulnerabilities. Please refer to the GIF provided below for an illustrative example.

**Pro Tip**: For optimal results, search using protocol names or port numbers. This approach is more effective than entering a full sentence or broad query.

### As an AI-driven assistant
**DISCLAIMER**: The results provided by this tool may contain inaccuracies or may not be suitable for all scenarios. We highly recommend users to review and, if necessary, modify the suggested commands before executing them. Proceed with caution and always ensure you are acting within legal and ethical boundaries
Queries can be presented naturally to the AI-driven assistant, which then translates them into specific commands. In the current beta release, it is essential for the ethical hacker to have prior familiarity with this tool to formulate valid inquiries effectively. Refer to the example provided below for a demonstration.

**Pro Tip**: In the beta version, for optimal performance, limit your queries to a combination of up to two switches.



## DocuNebula

Upon initial access to Nebula, users are greeted with several options:

- Enter a new command (c).
- View previous results (v).
- Process previous results (currently limited to NMAP) (PR).
- Select a model (m).
- Search by keywords (s).
- Escape prompt screen without entering a prompt.
- Results storage.
- Exit the application (q).

**Enter a New Command**: This prompt allows users to input commands using natural language. Subsequently, the system predicts and suggests a command for execution. Users have the discretion to either execute the generated command as is or modify it. After initiating the command, they can choose to await its completion or proceed with other tasks.

**Pro Tip**: In the beta version, for optimal performance, limit your queries to a combination of up to two switches.

**View Previous Results**: After a command's execution, users can review the output via this option.

**Process Previous Results**: Currently optimized for NMAP results, Nebula enables users to select previous scan findings and obtain command suggestions to assess potential vulnerabilities of uncovered ports. Users have the flexibility to select a suggested command, modify it if needed, and execute. Support for results from other tools is planned for future releases.

![Run Suggested Command](/images/run_processed_results.png)

**Select a Model**: Users can choose from one of the three available natural language processing models.

**Search by keywords**: By leveraging this feature, users can input keywords—such as port numbers or protocol names—and obtain command suggestions to identify vulnerabilities related to that specific protocol.
**Pro Tip**: For optimal results, search using protocol names or port numbers. This approach is more effective than entering a full sentence or broad query.

**Results Storage**: A folder named `results` is created (if it does not already exist) in the working directory where nebula is invoked.

**Escape prompt screen without entering a prompt**: To escape the prompt screen without entering a prompt, simply hit the enter key.

## Contributing

Should you encounter inaccuracies in the model's responses to your natural language prompts, or face any other challenges, we kindly request that you create an issue to document the specifics. Your feedback is invaluable to our continuous improvement efforts.
